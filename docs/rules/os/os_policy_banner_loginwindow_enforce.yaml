title: "Display Policy Banner at Login Window"
discussion: |
  Displaying a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures that users are provided with privacy and security notification verbiage that is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
  
  System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
  
  The policy banner will show if a "PolicyBanner.rtf" or "PolicyBanner.rtfd" exists in the "/Library/Security" folder.
  NOTE: 
    The banner text of the document _MUST_ read:

    "You are accessing a U.S. Government information system, which includes: 1) this computer, 2) this computer network, 3) all Government-furnished computers connected to this network, and 4) all Government-furnished devices and storage media attached to this network or to a computer on this network.
